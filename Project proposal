Project Title: The Modern Goalkeeper’s Dilemma: Between the Posts and Beyond the Box
Proposer: [Yasin Yılmaz]

2. Executive Summary
In modern football, the goalkeeper’s responsibilities have evolved dramatically. No longer confined to traditional shot-stopping, goalkeepers are now expected to participate actively in team buildup, distribution, and tactical play. This shift—popularized by managers like Pep Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp—creates a “goalkeeper dilemma”: the trade-off between defensive reliability and offensive contribution.
This project aims to analyze how this tactical evolution affects goalkeeper performance, team strategy, and recruitment criteria using statistical data, tactical analysis, and expert interviews.
3. Background / Problem Statement
Historically, goalkeepers were evaluated based on reflexes, positioning, and command of the penalty area. However, with the rise of possession-based football and high pressing systems, teams now require goalkeepers who can play with their feet, initiate attacks, and operate almost as an extra defender.
This dual expectation introduces tension: should clubs prioritize traditional goalkeeping skills or modern playmaking abilities? Some top teams (e.g., Manchester City with Ederson, Bayern Munich with Neuer) embrace the “sweeper-keeper” model, while others still prefer more conventional keepers.
The lack of consensus highlights a gap in understanding how this transition impacts team performance and tactical identity.
4. Objectives
Analyze the evolution of the goalkeeper’s tactical role from 2000–2025.
Compare performance metrics (save %, pass accuracy, progressive passes, defensive actions outside the box) among elite goalkeepers.
Assess how different playing styles (possession-based vs. direct) influence the ideal goalkeeper profile.
Propose a balanced model defining the optimal skill mix for modern goalkeepers.
5. Project Scope and Deliverables
Scope:
Focus on top European leagues (Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga)
Time frame: 2000–2025
Data-driven and qualitative analysis
Deliverables:
A research report (~20 pages) with data visualizations
Comparative statistical profiles of 10–15 elite goalkeepers
Tactical case studies (e.g., Neuer, Alisson, Ederson, Courtois)
Final presentation and recommendations
6. Methodology / Approach
Data Collection:
Obtain goalkeeper statistics from reliable databases (FBref, StatsBomb, Transfermarkt).
Quantitative Analysis:
Use Python or Excel to analyze trends in metrics like:
Save %
Pass accuracy (short, long, under pressure)
Defensive actions outside the penalty area
Goal prevention vs. build-up involvement scores
10. Expected Outcomes
A clearer understanding of how modern tactics redefine goalkeeper value.
A data-backed framework helping coaches and scouts identify goalkeepers suited to their team’s style.
Insights into how future goalkeeper training should balance footwork and traditional skills.
11. Conclusion
This project bridges tactical theory and performance analytics to address one of football’s most dynamic evolutions: the transformation of the goalkeeper role. By blending data and tactical context, the study aims to clarify the balance between risk and reliability—the essence of the modern goalkeeper’s dilemma.
